            <p>Welcome to the Dream Garage Builder Website! On this website, you will be able to build your very own dream garage by selecting from our exotic list of cars. To start, simply click on the “Car List” tab to view our selection of cars. When you see a car you like, click on the “Add to Your Garage” button to add the car into your digital garage (select as many as you like). Once you are satisfied with your selection, head over to the “My Garage” tab to see all your cars. In the “My garage” tab, you can see all the cars you selected from the car list tab. At the bottom of the “My garage” tab, we have calculated the total cost of all the cars within your garage…. Hopefully, you can afford it!</p>
