## General Overview 
The goal of this website is to help people build their very own digital dream garage. What’s a dream garage? It’s a garage filled with every car you have ever wanted! 

The “car list” tap is where we keep all the digital cars, but if we are missing a car users can add another one via the form button. Once a user sees a car they like, clicking on the “Add to Your Garage” button will add the car into their digital garage (they can select as many as they want). Once they are satisfied with their selection, they can head over to the “My Garage” tab to see all their cars. 

In the “My garage” tab, they can see all the cars they selected from the car list tab. At the bottom of the “My garage” tab, the website calculates the total cost of all the cars within your garage. These gives the use an idea of how realistic, or unrealistic their dream garage is. If a user finds that their dream garage is to expense, they can remove a car by click on the “remove from garage” button. Users can also view more details about any of the cars in their garage by clicking “more detail” withing the car card.
